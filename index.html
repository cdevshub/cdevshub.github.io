<h1>Myko FAQ</h1>
<h2 class="center">Welcome to Myko Frequently Asked Questions!</h2>
<p><strong>Your first stop for answers:</strong></p>

<div class="toc">
	<p class=toc>• <a href="#SetUp">Getting Set Up with the Myko Mobile App</a></p>

<h1 class="category" id="SetUp">Getting Set Up with the Myko Mobile App </h1>

<h2>Where can I find the Myko app?</h2>
<p>The Myko app is free and available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. Just search for “Myko” on your mobile phone.</p>

<h2>Which mobile devices does the Myko app support?</h2>
<p>The Myko app currently runs on:</p>
<ul>
	<li>iPhones and iPads currently running iOS 16.x, 15.x, 14.x, 13.x, or 12.x</li>
	<li>Android products running Oreo 8 and above</li>
</ul>
<p>The supported versions of the operating systems (OS) will change over time as new versions are released by Apple and Google. Users should keep their mobile devices up to date with the latest available OS version.</p>

<h2>What permissions does the Myko app require?</h2>
<p>The Myko app requires that you have <strong>Bluetooth</strong> turned on, asks that you have enabled and allowed access to <strong>Location</strong> services, and requires access to the <strong>Camera</strong>, and in some cases <strong>Photos</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bluetooth (“Nearby Devices” in Android) access  is required for adding Myko products to your account and then controlling them when Wi-Fi is not available. You do not need to pair your Myko products with Bluetooth explicitly; that happens for you automatically in the background.</li>
	<li>Location access permission is first requested when onboarding a product. Access is not required to operate Myko products in general, but is required for some specific functions, such as when using sunrise/sunset as a reference point in scheduling. Also, information provided when you allow Location service access can be helpful for product development, support, and diagnostic services. For more information, please refer to the Myko Privacy policy.
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> For Android mobile phones, please select “Precise” mode when turning on Location services. This mode enables GPS.</p></li>
	<li>Camera access is required to scan QR Codes when you add products to your Myko account.</li>
	<li>Photo access is required if you wish to customize the images for your homes or rooms.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where can I find the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service?</h2>
<p>The Privacy Policy and Terms of Service are available by opening the main menu in the Myko app:</p>
<ol>
	<li>From the Myko Home screen, tap the menu icon <span class="large">&#x2261;</span> at the top-left of the screen.</li>
	<li>Tap either <span class="UIText">Terms of Service</span> or <span class="UIText">Privacy Policy</span> to open the relevant text.</li>
</ol>

<h1 class="category" id="Manage">Managing Myko Accounts and Adding Products </h1>

<h2>How do I create an account and set up a Myko product?</h2>
<p>From your phone, download the Myko mobile app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open the Myko app and tap <span class="UIText">Sign In</span>.</li>
	<li>Tap <span class="UIText">Register</span> to create and sign in to your new Myko account.</li>
	<li>To add a product, tap the circular <span class="UIText">+</span> icon in the lower-right of the screen, then select <span class="UIText">Add a New Product</span>.
		<p><strong>Note:</strong>  At this point you may be prompted to turn on Bluetooth and allow access to both Location services and the Camera.</p>
	</li>
	<li>On the Scan Product screen that appears, scan the QR code on the new Myko product as directed on-screen.</li>
	<li>Connect your Myko product to power (if you haven’t already).</li>
	<li>Follow on-screen instructions in the app to set up Wi-Fi.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Can I set up a Myko product without a QR code?</h2>
<p>Yes. Follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>In the Myko app, tap the circular icon <span class="UIText">+</span> then select <span class="UIText">Add a New Product</span>.</li>
	<li>On the Scan Product screen, tap the magnifying glass/search button on the bottom-right of the screen.</li>
	<li>Follow the instructions in the Myko app for adding your product. You’ll be guided through the “Discover Products” steps.</li>
	<li>When the product or products are ready to be added, the Myko app will list the product(s). If multiple products are found, you can tap the info <span class="UITextLC">&#9432;</span> icon  on a specific product icon to cause it to pulse as the product identifies itself: 
		<ul>
			<li>Lighting products will blink on/off.</li>
			<li>Other products with an LED (e.g., plug or dimmer) will blink green.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>As you add products, you’ll be prompted to name and add them to your Wi-Fi network.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What if the Myko app doesn’t show my Wi-Fi network when I add a product?</h2>
<p>The Myko app will display only 2.4GHz Wi-Fi networks that your Myko product can detect. Myko requires access to a 2.4GHz network.</p>
<p>If you don’t see your Wi-Fi network listed, make sure your Wi-Fi router has a 2.4GHz network enabled. Also, make sure your Myko product is within range of your Wi-Fi signal.</p>

<h2>How do I remove a product from my account?</h2>
<p>To remove a product from your Myko account:</p>
<ol>
	<li>From the Myko Home screen, tap the name of your product to open the product’s controls.</li>
	<li>Tap <span class="UIText">Settings</span> in the lower-right corner of the screen to open the product Settings screen.</li>
	<li>Scroll to the bottom of the screen and tap <span class="UIText">Remove</span>.</li>
	<li>You’ll be asked to confirm.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Can I allow someone to transfer my product to their Myko account?</h2>
<p>Yes, it’s simple. Tell them to scan the product’s QR code, confirm they want the product transferred, and it will be added to their account and removed from yours.</p>

<h2>How do I change my password?</h2>
<ol>
	<li>On the Account signin screen, select <span class="UIText">Forgot Password</span>.</li>
	<li>Enter the email address associated with your Myko account.</li>
	<li>You’ll be sent a reset link that will take you to a web page where you can enter a new password.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are already signed into your account, you will need to sign out to reach the Account signin screen and the Forgot Password link.</p>

<h2>Can I share my Myko account?</h2>
<p>Yes. Myko allows multiple mobile devices to use the same account, allowing you to easily share access to your Myko products with people you trust. To share your account with your trusted friends and family, ask them to download the Myko app and then give them your Myko credentials.</p> 

<h1 class="category" id="Control">Controlling Myko Products through the App</h1>

<h2>How do I see details about my product and change the settings?</h2>
<p>There is a controls screen and a settings screen for each of your products. You reach these from the Myko Home screen by tapping the product from the list.</p>
<p>On the product’s controls screen you can set colors, speeds, view power consumption meters, and use other controls specific to your product. From this controls screen, you can also open the product Settings screen, where you can make advanced settings and view information for your product.</p>
<p>To reach your product’s controls:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Start from the Myko Home screen. You can always tap <span class="UIText">Products</span> in the lower-left of the screen to get your bearings.</li>
	<li>Tap your product’s entry on the screen. This will open your product’s controls. From this screen you can adjust the behavior of your product, create schedules for your product, set a timer (if available), and open the product’s Settings screen  (detailed below).</li>
</ol>
<p>To open your product’s Settings screen:<p>
<ol>
	<li>First go to the product's controls screen, then tap <span class="UIText">Settings</span> in the lower-right of the screen. That product’s Settings screen opens.</li>
	<li>At the top of this screen, some products may list “advanced” settings, but there are several sections that appear across all products: <span class="UIText">General</span>, <span class="UIText">Connectivity</span>, and <span class="UIText">Info</span>. Each section can expand or collapse. Just tap the up (<span class="UIText">&#94;</span>) or down (<span class="UIText">&#8964;</span>) arrowheads on the right to toggle the view. These sections contain information about your product, including the name you chose when you added your product, its room assignment, network connectivity details, and more.</li>
	<li>For settings that you can edit, tap the right-facing arrow.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Do Myko lighting products work with traditional/analog dimmers?</h2>
<p>No, Myko products do not work when connected to electrical circuits that have traditional dimmers on the same circuit. There’s a basic incompatibility. Myko products require full wall voltage to operate and control the lighting brightness using controls in the app. A traditional dimmer switch dims conventional bulbs by lowering the line voltage on the circuit, which will cause Myko products to lose power and drop offline.</p>

<h2>Can I control multiple products together in a group? For example, can I turn on multiple lights with one button tap?</h2>
<p>Yes. Myko allows you to place your products in groups and control them together. The controls that are available will be determined by the products you place in the group. This means:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you create a group that consists of products with similar controls, such as RGB lights, you will be able to operate a number of features from this group. For this specific case, you would be able to manage the power, brightness, white temperature, RGB color selection, and presets for the entire group of RGB lights.</li>
	<li>If you create a group that consists of products with different types of controls, such as an RGB light, a smart plug, and a ceiling fan, you will be able to operate only the controls that are common to all products. In this specific case, you would be able to turn power on and off to the group as a whole, but that’s all.
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Products that are placed in groups can still be operated individually.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To create a group, do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>On the Myko Home screen, tap the circular <span class="UIText">+</span> icon in the lower-right of the screen.</li>
	<li>From the options that open, select <span class="UIText">Create a New Group of Products</span>.</li>
	<li>On the Create Group screen, enter a name for your group and select the products you want to include in the group.</li>
	<li>Tap <span class="UIText">Save</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your new group will be listed on the Home screen. Tap the Group name to open the common controls for the group.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you’d like to access an individual product in the group, tap that product’s entry on the Home screen, or expand the group by tapping the little down <span class="UIText">&#8964;</span> arrowhead, then select the product you want to control.</li>
	<li>If you’d like to add or remove products from the group, select the group from the Home screen to open the Group Controls screen. Tap <span class="UIText">Edit Group</span> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where do I view and set up rooms?</h2>
<p>From the Myko Home screen, open the main menu (upper-left on screen) and tap <span class="UIText">Room Management</span>. There you will see all your rooms, and how many products are in each room.</p>
<p>To create a new room, tap the  menu icon <span class="large">&#8942;</span> to the right of the group name to open your options: <span class="UIText">Edit Name</span> or <span class="UIText">Delete Room</span>. Tap <span class="UIText">Create a New Room</span> at the bottom of the screen if you need another room.</p>

<h2>What are Favourites and how do I create them?</h2>
<p>”Favourites” are listed on their own screen and provide a filter on your products, showing just the products and groups of products that you want quick access to. Your list of Favourites is especially handy if you have a lot of Myko products on your Home page.</p>
<p>Add a product or group of products to your Favourites screen by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>From the Home screen, tap <span class="UIText">Favourites</span> at the bottom of the screen.
	<li>If you have no existing favourites, a message to that effect appears. To add favourites, tap the circular <span class="UIText">+</span> icon in the lower-right of the screen and select <span class="UIText">Manage your favourite products</span>.</li>
	<li>Your products and groups of products appear. Check the ones you want to appear on your Favourites screen, then tap <span class="UIText">OK</span>.</li>
	<li>You are returned to your Favourites screen with your recently-selected products and group listed. From here you can open each product’s controls.</li>
</ol>

<!-- 
<h2>What are Schedules, Moments, and Automations and how do I use them?</h2>
<p>A <strong>Moment</strong> captures the state of a product or group of products and saves it so you can return to the state with one tap.</p>
<p>A <strong>Schedule</strong> saves the state of a product or group of products so that at a specific time they will return to that state.</p>
<p>An <strong>Automation</strong> saves the state of product or group of products so that specific “events” will trigger a return to that state.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ol>
	<li>After dinner, I go to my living room and relax. I have four lamps in the room and have adjusted their color and brightness to just the way I like it in the evening. I like it so much I save the settings in a moment that I name “After-Dinner Relaxing”.</li>
	<li>I decide I want this moment to go on automatically at 7:30 each evening, so I set up a schedule for it, turning it on at 7:30pm and off at 11:00pm.</li>
	<li>I also think that I’d like that moment to trigger if the motion sensor by the front door detected motion between midnight and 5am, so I set up that automation.</li>
</ol>
